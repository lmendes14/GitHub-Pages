 As a programmer, my interests include AI, image classification, natural language processing, and more.
 
 Here are some of my hobbies:
 - Video games
 - Music
 - Programming

 I'm currently working on a project that predicts musical genres based on album covers using image classification. 
 Everything I learned for the project is from Stanford's [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). The repo is located on my GitHub account. 
 Here is my current work flow for the project:
 - [x] Scrape web to collect album covers along with their associated musical genres
 - [ ] Implement the several classification techniques from cs231n
 - [ ] Analyze results
 - [ ] Publish findings
